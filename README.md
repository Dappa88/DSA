# Data Structures in Python

![Data Structures](https://www.example.com/data-structures.png)

Welcome to the Data Structures repository! This project aims to provide a collection of essential data structures implemented in Python. Though the repository is still a work in progress, you can find implementations of the following data structures:

- Stacks
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Binary Trees

## Introduction

Understanding data structures is fundamental to becoming a skilled programmer. This repository serves as a learning resource for those interested in mastering data structures using Python. Each implementation is carefully designed and documented to provide clear explanations of the underlying concepts and algorithms.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are inserted and removed from the same end called the "top" of the stack. The following operations are supported:

- Push: Insert an element onto the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
- Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it.
- Is Empty: Check if the stack is empty.

### Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure composed of nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists come in various forms, such as singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. The following operations are supported:

- Insert: Insert a new node at a specified position in the linked list.
- Delete: Remove a node from the linked list.
- Search: Find a specific value within the linked list.

### Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are inserted at the "rear" end and removed from the "front" end of the queue. The following operations are supported:

- Enqueue: Insert an element at the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Remove and return the front element from the queue.
- Is Empty: Check if the queue is empty.

### Binary Trees

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used in computer science and form the basis of other data structures such as binary search trees and heaps.

## Usage

To use the implemented data structures, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dappa88/data-structures.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory of the specific data structure you want to explore.

3. Open the Python file containing the implementation.

4. Feel free to experiment with the provided code, test various scenarios, and gain insights into the working of the data structure.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are highly appreciated! Whether it's adding new data structures, improving existing implementations, or fixing bugs, your efforts will be invaluable in making this a comprehensive resource for learning data structures.
